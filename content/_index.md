I am an Associate Consultant at Oracle, passionate about building scalable and secure solutions while exploring new technologies. My experience spans across various domains including ETL, Analytics, Full-Stack and Mobile Developement.

## Professional Journey 🚀

I am an Associate Consultant at Oracle, currently working on Oracle Financial Services Analytical Applications (OFSSA) for the implementation of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) solutions for clients. My experience includes working with technologies like Pentaho, Java Spring Boot, and OBIEE, and collaborating in domains like ETL and Analytics.

Previously, I was a Front-End Developer Intern at Piombo, where I collaborated with the team to develop a web application and its design, utilizing React.js as the primary UI library.

I also interned as a Full-Stack Developer at Offeteria, where I led the tech team in developing a web application using the MERN stack. I designed the tech architecture and managed task execution and workflow. We utilized Heroku for test hosting and GitHub for collaboration.

Additionally, I was an App Developer Intern at Acuradyne Systems, where I developed web dashboard apps for data visualization using Dash (Python). I worked on the Kotlin Android SDK for developing Android applications interfacing with sensors, and utilized AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, CodePipeline, and EC2 for hosting Node.js web applications.
