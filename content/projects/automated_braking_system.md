## Project Overview üöó

The **Automated Braking System** is a prototype designed to enhance vehicle safety by automatically applying brakes when obstacles are detected. Developed using C programming on the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller with Keil IDE.

### Key Features üîë

- **Obstacle Detection**: Utilizes an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04 based) to detect obstacles.
- **Automatic Braking**: Automatically stops the vehicle when an obstacle is within a predefined range.
- **Microcontroller Implementation**: Programmed on the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller.
- **User Interface**: Includes an LCD display for system status.

### Hardware Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

- **Microcontroller**: LPC2148 (12MHz Fosc)
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: 4-pin HC-SR04 based sensor
- **Motor Driver IC**: L293D
- **Motors**: 2 DC motors
- **Power Supply**: Batteries
- **Additional Components**: LCD display
