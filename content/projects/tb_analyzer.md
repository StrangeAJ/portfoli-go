## Project Overview üöÄ

TB-Analyzer is an AI-based web application designed to detect tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-rays. Built with TensorFlow.js, it provides a platform for quick and accessible TB screening.

## Features ‚ú®
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes machine learning models trained on public datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based application accessible through any modern browser.
- **Instant Results**: Provides immediate analysis and feedback on uploaded X-ray images.

## Technical Implementation üõ†Ô∏è
- **Model Training**: Used TensorFlow to train the model using two public image datasets.
- **Frontend**: Developed using JavaScript and TensorFlow.js for running models in the browser.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on a scalable platform to handle multiple simultaneous users.

## Challenges & Solutions ü§ù
- **Challenge**: Handling large model sizes for efficient browser execution.
  - **Solution**: Optimized the model and utilized TensorFlow.js capabilities to run models efficiently in the browser.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring accuracy with limited dataset availability.
  - **Solution**: Combined multiple public datasets and implemented data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
